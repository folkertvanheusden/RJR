RJR
---
"Random Jamming Recorder" automatically records MIDI streams that come in through multicast (IP-MIDI)


installation
------------
This program requires a pip module:
    pip install MIDIUtil


usage
-----
Just start it.

If you need to configure the multicast address/port or if you play faster then 480bpm, change RJR.py.


note
----
If you miss data (notes, program changes, etc), check if your network drops multicast packets.
